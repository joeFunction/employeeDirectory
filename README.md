  ### User Story
    ``
    As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
    ``
  
  ### Usage

An employee or manager would benefit from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

### Functionality

Given a table of random profiles, when the user loads the page, a table of employee content should render. 

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by at first and last name category.

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
